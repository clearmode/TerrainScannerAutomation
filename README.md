# TerrainScannerAutomation
Automates the terrain scanner mod for minecraft by adding chunks to the queue and building them.


How to use: 

1. Type the X and Z coordinates of the northwest corner of the chunk you want to start with into the starting chunk box,
seperated by a comma, and press set.

2. Add the chunks you wish to build to the queue by pressing the North, East, South, or West buttons.
If you wish to remove a chunk from the queue, simply click on the row of the chunk you wish to remove and click "Remove Selected Chunk"

3. Once you have added all the chunks you wish to generate to the queue, stand facing the scanner queue and press "Numpad 7" to start.
Notes: The scanner queue must be placed directly to the left of the terrain scanner. Numlock must be on to stop and start.

4. Now simply go afk or watch a youtube video and the chunks you added to the queue will be built.
Note: the mouse must be on the minecraft client whenever it tries to start the next chunk or it will not work.

5. When the queue has been finished or you press "Numpad 8" the program will stop.

Note: make sure the terrain scanner is set to 8 blocks/t and gets enough power or the timing will be off.
